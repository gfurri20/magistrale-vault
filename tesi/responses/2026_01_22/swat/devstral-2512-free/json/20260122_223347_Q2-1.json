Additionally, the control signals (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, PLC1_C2, PLC2_C0) show coordinated but distinct control logic for each tank, further supporting the presence of two tanks."

The first pattern is observed in PLC1_IR0, which shows a cyclic behavior between high and low values, suggesting a filling and emptying cycle of one tank. The second pattern is observed in PLC2_IR0, which shows a similar but distinct cyclic behavior, indicating a second tank. The interactions between these two registers, along with the control signals (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, PLC1_C2, PLC2_C0), suggest coordinated operations between two tanks, such as one filling while the other is emptying, which is typical in water treatment processes for continuous operation."
