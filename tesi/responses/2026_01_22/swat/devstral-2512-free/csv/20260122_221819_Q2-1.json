This conclusion is drawn from the observation of two distinct patterns in the time-series data of PLC registers, particularly in the columns PLC1_IR0, PLC2_IR0, and PLC3_IR0. These patterns indicate the operation of two separate tanks, as the values and their transitions align with typical behaviors of tank level sensors or control signals in a water management system. Additionally, the presence of multiple control signals (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, etc.) further supports the idea of a system managing more than one tank."
