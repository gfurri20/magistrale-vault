This conclusion is drawn from the observation of distinct patterns in the time-series values of PLC registers, particularly in PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0, which exhibit behaviors consistent with the operation of two separate tanks. The periodic fluctuations and transitions in these registers indicate the filling and draining cycles typical of tank operations. Additionally, the coherence and correlation between these registers support the inference of two tanks working in tandem or independently within the system."
