PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0 exhibit different ranges and behaviors, with PLC1_IR0 often fluctuating between higher values and PLC2_IR0 showing more consistent but lower values. Additionally, the control registers (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, PLC1_C2, PLC2_C0) indicate different operational states for two separate systems, likely corresponding to two tanks. The presence of PLC3 registers with occasional activity suggests auxiliary components, but the primary operational patterns align with two main tanks."

            "reasoning": "The data shows two distinct patterns of behavior in the PLC registers that are consistent with the operation of two separate water tanks. PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0 exhibit independent filling and draining cycles, with PLC1_IR0 typically ranging from 40 to 80 and PLC2_IR0 ranging from 10 to 22. These ranges and cycles suggest two separate tanks with different capacities and operational dynamics. Additionally, the control signals (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, PLC1_C2, PLC2_C0) indicate independent control logic for each tank, further supporting the conclusion that there are two water tanks involved in the system."
