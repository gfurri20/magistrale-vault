    "answer": "Multi-tank liquid level control system (two main tanks with pumps for filling/emptying/transfer)",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "The dataset shows PLC1_InputRegisters_IW0 oscillating between approximately 40 and 80, and PLC2_InputRegisters_IW0 between 10 and 20, with inverse correlation: when PLC1 level decreases, PLC2 increases, and vice versa, indicating liquid transfer between two tanks via pumps. PLC1_MemoryRegisters_MW0=40 (low setpoint), MW1=80 (high setpoint); PLC2_MW0=10, MW1=20 similarly. PLC1_Coils_QX00-QX02 activate together (often 0,0,0 or 1,1,1) during transfer phases, likely controlling multiple pumps. PLC2_Coils_QX00 and PLC3_Coils_QX00 toggle similarly. PLC3_InputRegisters_IW0 mostly 1 (possibly flow sensor), PLC3_MemoryRegisters_MW1=10 constant. Previous values (prev_*) detect edges/changes for control logic. Pattern repeats cyclically with hysteresis control typical of tank level systems to avoid chattering."

    "answer": "Multi-tank liquid level control system or similar accumulating process (e.g., hoppers, reservoirs) with hysteresis or bang-bang control between low and high setpoints.",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "PLC1_IW0 oscillates between approximately 40 (PLC1_MW0 constant) and 80 (PLC1_MW1 constant), ramping up/down by 1 per timestep when coils QX00/QX01/QX02 are in states like [0,1,1] (decreasing) or [1,1,1] (increasing), [0,0,0] (idle/hold). PLC2_IW0 similarly oscillates between 10 (PLC2_MW0) and 20 (PLC2_MW1), controlled by PLC2_QX00 (1 increasing, 0 decreasing). PLC3_IW0 mostly constant at 1 (occasionally 2), MW1=10 constant, QX00 mostly 0, suggesting supervisory or sensor role. 'prev_' columns indicate lagged states for change detection or PID. Cyclic ramping patterns typical of PLC-simulated tank filling/draining tests. Constant MW values match setpoints."
