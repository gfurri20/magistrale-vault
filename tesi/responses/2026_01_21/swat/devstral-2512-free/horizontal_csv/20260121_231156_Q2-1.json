This conclusion is drawn from the observation of two distinct patterns in the time-series values of PLC registers, particularly in PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0.

This conclusion is drawn from the observation of two distinct patterns in the time-series values of PLC registers, particularly in PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0.

Additionally, the coherence between the control signals (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, PLC2_C0, PLC3_C0, PLC3_C1) and the input registers supports the inference of two tanks being managed by the system."

This conclusion is drawn from the observation of two distinct patterns in the time-series data of PLC registers, particularly in PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0. These patterns indicate the operation of two separate tanks, as evidenced by the periodic fluctuations and correlations in their values. Additionally, the control signals (PLC1_C0, PLC1_C1, PLC2_C0, PLC3_C0, PLC3_C1) show coordinated behavior that aligns with the operation of two tanks, further supporting this conclusion."
