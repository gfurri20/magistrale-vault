Each timestamp contains data points from all three PLCs, with no references to PLC4 or beyond. Given the operational context of a water system with three tanks, the presence of three PLCs aligns with typical ICS architectures where each PLC may control one tank. This makes 3 the definitive answer."

Each PLC has multiple registers (IR0, C0, C1, etc.), and the context of a Water & Wastewater System with three tanks supports having three PLCs managing different aspects of the operation.

No higher-numbered PLCs (PLC4-PLC10) appear in any records. The context of three water tanks also aligns with having three dedicated PLCs for control. This confirms exactly 3 PLCs are involved."
