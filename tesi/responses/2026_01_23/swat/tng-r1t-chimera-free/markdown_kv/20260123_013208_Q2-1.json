PLC1_IR0 (likely tank level) increases when PLC1_C0 is True (filling) and decreases when PLC1_C1/C2 are True (draining). PLC2_IR0 shows inverse behavior, consistent with water transfer between two tanks. PLC3's activity is minimal and does not suggest a third primary water tank, leading to the conclusion of 2 main water tanks involved in the ICS operations."

Simultaneously, PLC2_IR0 varies with PLC2_C0, indicating a second tank interacting with the first. PLC3's behavior suggests a control component rather than a water tank, leading to the conclusion that there are 2 water tanks in the system."

PLC3_IR0 occasionally activates (e.g., timestamp 977 when PLC3_C0 becomes True), possibly representing a third tank used for specific processes. However, PLC3's lower activity may indicate it's a smaller or auxiliary tank, leading to moderate confidence in this conclusion."

Control bits (C0, C1, C2) indicate pump operations correlating with level changes, strongly suggesting two distinct water tanks. PLC3 appears to monitor a different subsystem given its minor IR0 fluctuations (mostly 0-2)."

            "reasoning": "Analysis of the data indicates three distinct water tanks in operation. PLC1_IR0 (ranging 40-80) and associated control bits (C0, C1, C2) show regulated fill/drain cycles characteristic of a primary tank. PLC2_IR0 (10-22 range) shows inverse behavior with PLC1, indicating a secondary tank in a balanced system. PLC3_IR0 (0-3 range) shows occasional level changes and control activation (C0/C1), suggesting a smaller auxiliary tank or buffer tank. The cyclical patterns between these three units confirm three distinct water storage units being actively managed in the system."

PLC1's IR0 (likely Tank 1) shows filling (PLC1_C0=True) and draining (PLC1_C1/C2=True) patterns, while PLC2's IR0 (Tank 2) inversely correlates with these operations. PLC3 does not exhibit clear water tank behavior and may represent a different component type. The observed operational patterns strongly suggest two interconnected water tanks."

PLC1's IR0 (water level) increases when its pump (C0) is active and decreases when its drain valves (C1/C2) are active. PLC2's IR0 changes inversely with PLC1's drainage, indicating a second tank receiving water. PLC3 appears to monitor a different aspect but does not indicate an additional tank."

PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0 show interdependent level changes, suggesting water transfer between them. PLC1 fills when PLC1_C0 is True (IR0 increases), and water is likely transferred to PLC2 when PLC1_C1 and C2 are True (IR0 decreases while PLC2_IR0 increases). PLC3 shows minimal activity, likely not a primary water storage tank. The recurring pattern between PLC1 and PLC2 confirms two operational water tanks."
