PLC1's IR0 fluctuates between 40-80, controlled by C0, C1, and C2, suggesting a main tank. PLC2's IR0 varies between 10-22 with C0 as a control, indicating a second tank. PLC3's IR0 has limited range (0-3), likely not a main water tank. Thus, there are 2 water tanks."

PLC1_IR0 shows a fill-drain cycle correlated with PLC1_C0, C1, and C2, suggesting one tank. PLC2_IR0 inversely correlates with PLC1's drain phase, indicating a second tank. PLC3_IR0 occasionally activates during specific phases, suggesting a third tank. Thus, three water tanks are involved in the system."

The inverse relationship between PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0 suggests water transfer between two tanks. PLC3 likely controls auxiliary functions or a third smaller tank, but its minimal activity and low IR0 values suggest it's not a primary water storage tank."
