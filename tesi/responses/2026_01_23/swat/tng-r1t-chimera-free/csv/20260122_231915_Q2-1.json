            "reasoning": "The maximum value observed in the PLC3_IR0 register is 3, which likely indicates the number of active water tanks during operations. Although there are three PLCs involved, the PLC3_IR0's value of 3 occurs at multiple timestamps, suggesting that up to three tanks are active at certain operational stages. The other PLC registers don't indicate a higher number of tanks, and the system's behavior aligns with three tanks being used."

            "reasoning": "Upon analyzing the data, PLC1_IR0 shows significant level changes indicative of a main water tank. PLC2_IR0 and PLC3_IR0 have different patterns and lower ranges, suggesting they might represent additional tanks or other components. However, the primary tank involved in the operations based on the most dynamic and repetitive cycles appears to be controlled by PLC1. While there are hints at other tanks, the clear evidence points to one main tank being central to the operations."

            "reasoning": "The analysis identified three distinct water tanks based on sensor readings (IR0) from three PLCs (PLC1, PLC2, PLC3). Each PLC's IR0 values and associated control signals (C0, C1, C2) indicate independent management of separate water tanks. PLC1_IR0 (51-80 range) closely tracks water level in the primary tank, PLC2_IR0 (10-20) corresponds to a secondary tank, and PLC3_IR0 (0-3) shows discrete states of a third tank/treatment stage. Multiple instances (e.g., PLC3_IR0 reaching state 3 at timestamps 977 and 3801) confirm distinct tank behavior beyond just valves or pumps."

            "reasoning": "The analysis identified three distinct water tanks by observing the independent behavior of PLC1_IR0, PLC2_IR0, and PLC3_IR0, which likely represent the water levels of three separate tanks. Each tank's level fluctuates independently and is associated with different control coils (C0, C1, C2 for PLC1; C0 for PLC2; C0, C1 for PLC3). Specific instances, such as timestamp 977 where PLC3_IR0 reaches 3, further suggest the presence of a third tank."

            "reasoning": "The analysis of PLC registers indicates three distinct water tanks: \n1. PLC1_IR0 consistently shows water level changes controlled by PLC1_C0 (pump) and PLC1_C1 (valve), indicating Tank 1. \n2. PLC2_IR0 displays level variations tied to PLC2_C0, suggesting Tank 2. \n3. PLC3_IR0, though operating in a smaller range (0-3), shows discrete state changes with PLC3_C0/C1, implying a third tank used for specific operations. Interaction patterns (e.g., transfers between tanks) further support this conclusion."

            "confidence": 70,
            "reasoning": "The analysis of PLC1_IR0 and PLC2_IR0 registers shows cyclical patterns indicating two interconnected water tanks, where PLC1 controls the filling/draining of one tank and PLC2 likely controls another. Although PLC3_IR0 occasionally shows a value of 3 (possibly indicating a third tank or operational state), this occurs very rarely and briefly, insufficient to suggest a third tank is regularly involved in operations. The majority of system behavior points to 2 primary water tanks being actively managed during normal operations."

            "reasoning": "PLC3_IR0 values cycle mainly between 0, 1, 2, and rarely 3, suggesting four states. However, considering operational norms and the rarity of state 3, three water tanks are typically involved during standard operations. The fourth state (3) might represent an auxiliary or emergency tank."

            "reasoning": "The analysis of the data suggests interactions between at least two water tanks, primarily monitored by PLC1 and PLC2 through their IR0 registers. However, the presence of PLC3_IR0 reaching a value of 3 at several timestamps (e.g., 977, 2433, 3801) indicates a third tank is occasionally involved in operations. This, combined with the nature of Water & Wastewater Systems requiring multiple stages, supports the conclusion that three water tanks are involved during operations. The confidence is moderate due to the limited frequency of the third tank's activation."

While most operations use 0-2 tanks, the maximum observed count during operations was 3."
