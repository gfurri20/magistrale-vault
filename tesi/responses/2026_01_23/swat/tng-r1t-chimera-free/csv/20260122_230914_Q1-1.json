            "reasoning": "The data exhibits patterns indicative of controlled filling and emptying processes, consistent with tank level management in water systems. PLC1_IR0 shows cyclical variations (56-80), likely representing a tank level with PLC1_C0 controlling a pump or valve. PLC2_IR0 (10-20) could monitor flow or pressure, with PLC2_C0 activating during low-flow conditions. These behaviors align with water/wastewater treatment operations involving level regulation and pumping. The absence of characteristics specific to other categories (e.g., power generation metrics or manufacturing state machines) supports this classification."

PLC1 shows cyclic behavior (fill/drain cycles) indicative of tank level control. PLC2's interaction suggests valve control based on tank levels. PLC3's state changes (0-3) likely represent operational modes of a pump or treatment process. These patterns are characteristic of water processing systems, where maintaining and cycling liquid levels is central. The absence of high-pressure or temperature signals rules out Oil/Gas or Energy systems."

PLC2_IR0's narrower range suggests flow or pressure monitoring, while PLC3_IR0's intermittent values may indicate pump/valve states. These characteristics align with water system operations involving level control, flow management, and periodic pump activation, making 'Water & Wastewater System' the most probable classification."

Multiple PLCs coordinate these processes, which aligns with water treatment or distribution systems. The numeric ranges and control logic better match water/wastewater operations than manufacturing or energy systems, where sensor ranges and process dynamics would differ significantly. Resistance heating systems or batch reactors in other industries would show different time-series characteristics. Regular ON/OFF cycling of PLC1_C0/C1/C2 and PLC2_C0 suggests pump/valve control for liquid transfer."

This pattern aligns with manufacturing processes requiring precise temperature control, as seen in systems like injection molding, not water or energy systems."

PLC2 appears to control inflow/outflow valves, and PLC3 may handle supervisory functions. This pattern is typical of water/wastewater systems where level control and flow management are critical.

PLC2_IR0 trends inversely with PLC1_IR0, suggesting a secondary control loop (e.g., flow rate). The PLC3 interactions are sparse but may indicate system states. These patterns are characteristic of water distribution or wastewater treatment systems, where level and flow control are critical (e.g., pump controls, tank levels). The absence of high-frequency signals or motor currents makes Energy/Power less likely."
