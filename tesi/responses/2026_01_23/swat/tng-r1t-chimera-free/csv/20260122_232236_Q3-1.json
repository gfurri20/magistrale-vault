Analysis of the data shows active changes in values across all three PLCs' registers, confirming their involvement in the operations. No columns or data points indicating additional PLCs (e.g., PLC4 or higher) were found in the headers or data rows, ruling out higher counts. Given the explicit presence and activity of three distinct PLCs, the answer is confidently determined to be 3."

There are no indications of additional PLCs in the dataset, as all register names are prefixed with these three PLC identifiers. Thus, three PLCs are involved in the operations."
