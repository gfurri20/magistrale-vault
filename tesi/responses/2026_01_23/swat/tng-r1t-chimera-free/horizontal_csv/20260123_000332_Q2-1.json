PLC1_IR0 operates in the 40-80 range (likely main storage tank), while PLC2_IR0 operates in the 10-22 range (likely smaller auxiliary tank). PLC3_IR0 values (0-3) and minimal binary activity suggest it's not tank-related. Binary controls (C0, C1, C2) from both PLC1 and PLC2 show activation patterns consistent with tank control systems. The differing value ranges and independent patterns strongly indicate two separate water tanks in the system."

PLC3_IR0 does not exhibit behavior typical of a water tank level sensor and is more likely related to another component such as valves or switches."

PLC1_IR0 shows cyclical patterns typical of water level changes in a tank, with associated control signals in PLC1_C0. Similarly, PLC2_IR0 exhibits distinct fluctuations likely representing a second tank, controlled by PLC2_C0. PLC3_IR0 appears to represent discrete states rather than a continuous tank level, suggesting it does not correspond to an additional tank. The confidence level is high due to the clear cyclical patterns and independent control signals associated with each tank."

PLC3_IR0 values (0-3) suggest a discrete state device rather than a tank. The operational coupling between PLC1_C0/PLC1_C1 and PLC2_C0 indicates separate tank control systems. The cyclic behavior in IR0 trends supports two distinct filling/draining processes characteristic of two interconnected water tanks."

PLC1_IR0 shows cyclic filling/draining behavior (40-80 range) correlated with PLC1_C0 (pump control), while PLC2_IR0 (10-22 range) shows similar behavior with PLC2_C0. PLC3 appears to control a different non-tank component (state machine behavior). The identical patterns in PLC1_C1/C2 suggest redundant controls rather than separate tanks. This points to 2 distinct water tanks in the system."

PLC1_IR0 shows active fill/drain cycles, PLC2_IR0 shows smaller fluctuations suggesting a secondary tank, and PLC3_IR0 has discrete state changes indicating a third tank. All three are considered involved in system operations, even though PLC3's activity is minimal."

PLC1_IR0 values cycle between ~45-80 (likely a primary tank), PLC2_IR0 cycles between ~10-22 (secondary tank), and PLC3_IR0 shows 0-3 integer steps (likely a chemical dosing/storage tank). The boolean registers (C0/C1/C2) show coordinated control patterns for each tank's fill/drain cycles. While PLC3 has lower values, integer stepping behavior and industrial wastewater context suggest it represents a third tank component."

PLC1_IR0 shows cyclical behavior typical of a filling/draining tank, while PLC2_IR0 exhibits similar but independent patterns.
